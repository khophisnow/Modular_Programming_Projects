# 🧠 Modular C++ Programming
Solutions to modular programming exercises from **Tony Gaddis' _Starting Out with Programming Logic and Design, 3rd Edition_**.

![Banner](./banner.png)

## 📚 Description
This project is a collection of beginner-to-intermediate level programming exercises implemented in **C++**, with a focus on **modular program design**. Each exercise is split into `.h` and `.cpp` modules and tied together in a menu-driven `main.cpp` file.

## 🛠 Features

- ✔️ Clean modular structure
- ✔️ Real-world problem simulation (e.g., BMI calculator, Property tax, Paint job estimator)
- ✔️ Menu-based user interface
- ✔️ Compile automation with Makefile
- ✔️ Input validation and formatted outputs

---

## 🔧 Build Instructions

### ✅ Compile using Makefile
```bash
make
```

### 🏃 Run the program
```bash
./ModularProgram
```

### 📦 Clean build files
```bash
make clean
```

> Ensure you're using a C++17+ compatible compiler (`g++`, `clang++`, etc.)
